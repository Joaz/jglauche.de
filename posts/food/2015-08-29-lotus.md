17:47 < algoldor> I'm preparing lotus root snacks today - first washed in watter, peeled, cut no thin 2-3 slices (kept at slightly acidic water to prevent oxidation), 
                  moved to another slightly acidic water (for both any vinegar is fine), boiled for 2-5 min, strained and bit dried out on the air and finally fried in 
                  a bit of oil on a pan with spices added as fusion recipe feels. The final snack is really interesting because of the texture which is typical for lot
