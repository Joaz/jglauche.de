Here's a brief list of events that happened:

* I went to the third psychologist for the letter in late September 2016, was drugged on benzos for the week before that due to endless anxiety
* The appointment with the psychologist went well, promised to write the letter quickly, but took almost 2 months in the end
* Court approval of my name change arrived at December 7, 2016 (Date sent by court: 30th November)
* Court approval of my name change with a stamp "became legal" (Rechtskräftig) arrived on January 2rd, 2017
* It took until February 6th to get the registry (Standesamt) to issue my new birth certificate with correct name and gender (had to pay 14€)
* I went to other part of the registry (Einwohnermeldeamt) on the same day. They told me that I would need to be deleted and sent me home with a promise to call back within 2 days.
* They didn't call back, so I bothered a college of the person supposed to do that on the phone, and them 5 minutes for doing so
* I got my preliminary passport on February 10th
* I registered my business on February 15th

Total court cost of the name change: **2099,60€** (3 psychologist letters + court fees). Not included in those are fees of the referring psychiatrist (around 10€), an early copy of my birth certificate, transportation to and parking fees (3,80€) at the court and the new birth certificate.

Total cost for the new documents, including photo, driver's license, passport: **148,10€**

Total cost for my name change: **2289,50€**
