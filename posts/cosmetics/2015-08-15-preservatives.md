I'm making this blog post for our [workshop]{:target="_blank"} at CCC Camp 2015. I am planning to write more about cosmetics in this blog later on. You can find my recipes on [github]{:target="_blank"} at the moment.

### Why would you want to add preservatives? 

Whenever you mix cosmetics that contain water, you're creating a mixture where microorganism can live and multiply. 

### Isn't it enough to work cleanly?  

It is a good practice to work cleanly and desinfect your tools before using them, but you will not be able to create cosmetics completely free of microorganisms. You cannot sterilize cosmetics.
 
If you however do want to avoid preservatives, you can put the cosmetics in a fridge. The lower temperature makes microorganisms to *grow slower*. A cream may last up to a couple of weeks in there.


### Preservatives overview

#### Parabens

The group of [parabens]{:target="_blank"} are commonly used in commercial cosmetics. They are cheap in industrial quantities and very effective against bacteria and fungi. 

Some people however do have allergic reactions to them.

Parabens are available for homemade cosmetics too via [Spinnrad]{:target="_blank"} and [Amazon]{:target="_blank"}

**Usage concentration:** Between 1-2,0% in creams for 3-6 month.
