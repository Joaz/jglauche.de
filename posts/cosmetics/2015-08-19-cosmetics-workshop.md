I've done a cosmetics [workshop]{:target="_blank"} with my wonderful friend Jaga at CCC Camp 2015. 

We had about 11 or 12 participants (we planned in for 6, 10 max.) and we only had 3 scales but managed to get everyone home with a cream and a lip balm nevertheless.

I am happy to announce about that the workshop did cover our expenses completely.

### Skin Cream

We did my previously tested [recipe]{:target="_blank"} for the skin cream. I remember getting a few questions about it, which I want to answer for everybody:

#### Can the lavender oil be exchanged?
Yes. Leave it out, replace with one or more essential oils if you like. I personally like a light scent of lavender a lot. Some people don't. Be experimental on what you like or not!

#### I've accidentally put too much glycerin in
The participant asking did put in 5g instead of 1,5g. This causes the cream to be sticky. I recommended to put the cream onto wet skin if you don't want to throw it away. You can make a lotion too by adding more water

#### I have put in too much oils / water
The cream will be getting more runny, but it is not a big problem if you are within let's say 10% of the desired amount

#### It started to get flaky after adding the water
The temperature has gotten too low. Put it into the water bath and stir until it completely liquifies.

#### The emulsion doesn't mix
Okay, this can have a number of problems. First one could be that there is too little of emulsifier in it. The emulsifier and/or the beeswax could be too cold. Heat it up, but not higher than about 65Â°C. Try again. If stirring doesn't work, try using an electric tool (which we didn't have) or use a container where you can shake it.

#### Water from the water bath came into the mixture
I remember having two or three people having this problem. I remember having one pot completely submerged, which I cleaned up and let the participant start over. Also I remember a small girl getting a bit of water into the cream at a later point. I recommended to add less of destilled water and it worked.


### Lip Balm

Me and Jaga have tried out this recipe the evening before the workshop. The recipe is very simple:

4g Beeswax

4g Shea Butter

2g Apricot Oil

Heat up Beeswax after liquid, add Shea Butter. After liquid add Apricot Oil. Fill into [lip balm containers]{:target="_blank"}. 

The recipe is for about two of those containers. The Oil can be exchanged with many other oils

### I will answer your questions!
