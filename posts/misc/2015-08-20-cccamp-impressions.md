I've put together a number of impressions from [CCCamp]{:target="_blank"} that I want to share.

### 3D Printed Stethoscope

After [Tareks wonderful inspiring talk]{:target="_blank"} we went to the CERT (Chaos Emergency Reponse Team) and showed the 3d printed stethoscope head which [I designed]{:target="_blank"} to the medical people there.

I was very tired as I did drive for about 8 hours before and I don't remember much more unfortunately.

### Cooking for 300 Angels

Meet Hendi, the slicing machine that I took care of in my two hour volunteer shift as angel.

I have chopped up two boxes of red cabbage, a box of cucumbers and two boxes of carrots. The ingredients were then mixed in *huge* boxes

### Weather Baloon

Some guys launched a weather baloon filled with Hydrogen. I was there to see the launch!

Two vaccum cleaners were managing deliveries:
