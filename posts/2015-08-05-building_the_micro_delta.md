Some time ago, I assembled a [Micro Delta]{:target="_blank"} kit. The Wiki page states:

~~~~~~~~
The main goal/idea of the ÂµDelta is to "make it easy and fun".
~~~~~~~~

Sounds promising, right?

I made a lot of pictures from my attempt to build it and put them into this imgur [album]{:target="_blank"}. 

#### Does it print?

So far, no. And it's a real pain to fix things on this machine

- One of the endstops still doesn't work properly, as it has been installed in the wrong way. 
- The bowden tube mount on the extruder has no way to stay in place
- The delta arms have too much play around the carriage, it's very wiggly
- The extruder motor is underpowered
